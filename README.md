# EasyConcurrency
EasyConcurrency nugets aim to make concurrency easier for your .NET Core Applications. The main motivation for this project was the fact that Entity Framework does not have a built-in solution for pessimistic concurrency control.

Be it optimistic or pessimistic concurrency control, EasyConcurrency can help you with both of them.

If you are new to concurrency handling, you can read more about [Optimistic concurrency control](https://github.com/lukaskuko9/EasyConcurrency/blob/readmes/Readme/OptimisticConcurrency.md) or
[Pessimistic concurrency control](https://github.com/lukaskuko9/EasyConcurrency/blob/readmes/Readme/PessimisticConcurrency.md) directly in this repository.

## EasyConcurrency.EntityFramework
EasyConcurrency.EntityFramework provides base implementations for concurrency handling when using EntityFramework. 

For installation options, visit the packkage on [Nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EasyConcurrency.EntityFramework/).
